This is a project in progress, feel free to branch and work on it yourself.
This is a personal project, so I will not be accepting modifications.
This is just to release it to the public, so you can use it or work on it from here.
It uses googlemaps library in python: (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python)
It creates a walking, running or cycling route in your area
I plan to run this and display the result on a webpage using an embedded google map, but I am not competent enough in JavaScript to write the whole program on it

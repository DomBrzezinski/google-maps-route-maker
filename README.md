This is a project in progress, feel free to download and use it yourself, or modify it to your needs.
All work here is freely available to anyone.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Download routeFinder.py and create a .txt file named "key.txt" in the same folder. In the folder, paste your Google API Key and save the file. You can get a Google Cloud Platform account and Google API Key at "https://console.cloud.google.com/". Dowload and install the googlemaps python library with "pip install googlemaps", and run the program in python 3.9.

This program creates a walking, running or cycling route in your area.
It uses googlemaps library in python: (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python).
I plan to run this and display the result on a webpage using an embedded google map at some point.

This program creates a walking, running or cycling route in your area.
It uses googlemaps library in python: (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python).
I plan to run this and display the result on a webpage using an embedded google map at some point.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Download files and create a .txt file named "key.txt" in the same directory. In the file, paste your Google API Key and save the file. Replace the API Key in the URL in the site.html file with a different key, which has your IP Address whitelisted.  You can get a Google Cloud Platform account and Google API Key at "https://console.cloud.google.com/". Dowload and install the googlemaps python library with "pip install googlemaps", and run the program in python 3.9.

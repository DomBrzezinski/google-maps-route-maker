This program creates a walking, running or cycling route in your area.
It uses googlemaps library in python: (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python).
It currently only displays the waypoints as a string on the webpage, but I am working on passing this data into an embedded Google Map.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Download files and create a .txt file named "key.txt" in the same directory. In the file, paste your Google API Key and save the file. Replace the API Key in the URL in the site.html file with a different key, which has your IP Address whitelisted.  You can get a Google Cloud Platform account and Google API Key at "https://console.cloud.google.com/".
